This document is the work-in-progress for the [Friendly Tahoma Geeks](http://groupspaces.com/FriendlyTahomaGeeks) code of conduct policy.

----

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Friendly Tahoma Geeks is to be inclusive of participants with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Friendly Tahoma Geeks to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
