# Code of Conduct Policy for [Friendly Tahoma Geeks](http://friendlytahomageeks.com/)

----

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Friendly Tahoma Geeks is to be inclusive of participants with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Friendly Tahoma Geeks to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and constructive way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- When taking pictures or recording video and/or audio of other participants, obtain their permission first.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. If you cannot identify a community organizer send e-mail to [contact@friendlytahomageeks.com](mailto:contact@friendlytahomageeks.com).

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 6. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify [contact@friendlytahomageeks.com](mailto:contact@friendlytahomageeks.com) with a concise description of your grievance.

## 7. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
